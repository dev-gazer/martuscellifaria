# AboutMe
Hi there! My name is Alexandre Martuscelli Faria, but you are welcomed to call me Alex if you want to! I hold a degree in mechanical engineering and I'm about to finish my PhD on wind turbine noise. After working extensively with Matlab, Python and C++ for research and engineering applications, I have decided to try something new as a software developer. I grew confidence rapidly in Python and learned about Docker containers and remote interactions with cloud services as Google Cloud Platform and BigQuery. Some colleagues and co-workers gave me an advice of trying Java, PHP and JavaScript. A whole new world has opened! Currently learning some React and Firebase, but back and forth with pure JavaScript and Html/CSS. I have a personal goal of moving back to Germany, where I lived for some time during my graduation.
